# IrisClassification
This project implements a machine learning model to classify Iris flowers into different species based on their sepal and petal characteristics.
##Conclusion
This kernel described and explored the classic Iris dataset with data visualizations. And we also experimented with 4 machine learning models: 2 linear and 4 non-linear models.
I examined the training results with 10-fold cross validation and chose SVC as the best model with testing confusion matrix output and classification report.
